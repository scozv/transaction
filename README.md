# RESTful API Demo of Transaction Service

## Overview

The codes for challenge assignment are written within 3 consecutive day.
Percisely, they are started from `Sep 3, 08:47` to `Sep 4, 19:46`. (see picture below)

In recent two days, I did some code clear up.

The codes in `test/WithApplication.scala` are copied from `Play! 2.3`
in order to make the `Specs2` tests of `Play! 2.3` even when I upgraded
project to `Play! 2.4`.
